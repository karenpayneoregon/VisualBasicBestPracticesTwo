The task is to read data from a comma delimited file, display fields from a specific line in TextBox controls.

There are two ideas here:

- Display information read-only
- Display information which can be edited

New to coding the idea is to place one TextBox per field where fields are stored in an array, cycle through each element and display the data. Usually TextBox names are TextBox1, TextBox2 etc were names are meaningless which is okay for display only yet when working with data which can be editable it's best to have meaningful names and also way to know when data has change so that the data when updated programmically can be updated easily.

This project presents one clear cut method to fullfill the above requirements.
